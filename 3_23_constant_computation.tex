In the next two sections, we'll use the formalism we developed and actually calculate things.  There aren't many
examples of calculations in $\RO(G)$-graded cohomology, except for what people needed for other things: Stong has
some lecture notes which might be published, and the motivic homotopy theorists (specifically Dugger and Voevodsky)
used the $C_2$-equivariant category as a model for the motivic setting, and wrote up some calculations.  See,
e.g.,~\cite{Lew88, Dug15}.

The takeaway is that, even for groups such as $C_4$, calculating the Bredon cohomology of a point would almost be a
paper. People probably know what it is, but it would be interesting to understand. The equivariant Steenrod and
Dyer-Lashof algebras are also not understood well; Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel figured some of it out, but might not have
written all of it down. This would be hard to attack via a Cartan-style seminar, unfortunately.

Thus, it's not at all trivial that we're computing $H_{C_2}^*(*;\underline\Z)$. Recall that $\underline\Z$ comes
from the coefficient system
\[\xymatrix{
	M(C_2/C_2)\\
	M(C_2/e),\ar[u]\ar@(dl,dr)_{}
}\]
but as a Mackey functor there's also a transfer map $f_*$:
\[\xymatrix{
	M(C_2/C_2)\ar@/^0.4cm/[d]^{f_*}\\
	M(C_2/e).\ar@/^0.4cm/[u]^{f^*}\ar@(dl,dr)_\gamma
}\]
\begin{ex}
Show that the double coset formulae force $f_*f^* = 1+\gamma$ and $f^*f_* = 2$.\footnote{\TODO: I'd like to
double-check that I got this correct.}
\end{ex}
For $\underline\Z$,
\begin{itemize}
	\item The coefficients are $M(C_2/C_2) = \Z$ and $M(C_2/e) = \Z$.
	\item $f^* = \id$, $f_*$ is multiplication by $2$, and $\gamma = \id$.
\end{itemize}
We'll introduce a bigrading on $H^*_{C_2}$, since $C_2$ has two irreducible $1$-dimensional representations: the
trivial representation on $\R$ and the sign representation $\sigma$. Thus, let $H_{C_2}^{p,q}$ denote $H_{C_2}^V$,
where $V$ contains $p$ copies of the trivial representation and $q$ copies of $\sigma$.
\begin{rem}
There's an alternative \term{motivic indexing} $H_{C_2}^{p+q,q}$, where $q$ counts the number of copies of $\sigma$
and $p+q$ counts the total underlying dimension. We're not going to use this grading.
\end{rem}
We'll first compute the additive structure, then sew things together.

By adjunction, $H_{C_2}^{p,q}(C_2)\cong H^{p+q}(*)$ (ordinary cohomology), because $[C_{2+}\wedge X, Y]_{C_2}\cong
[X,Y]$. Thus,
\[H_{C_2}^{p,q}(C_2) = H^{p+q}(*) = \begin{cases}
	\Z, &p+q=0\\
	0, &\text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}\]
Next we'll compute $H_{C_2}^{p,q}(*)$. Let $S^{\sigma q}$ denote the representation sphere that's the one-point
compactification of $\R^{\sigma q}$ (i.e.\ $q$ copies of the sign representation); then, if $q > 0$,
\[H_{C_2}^{p,-q}(*)\cong \wH_{C_2}^{p,-q}(S^0)\cong \wH_{C_2}^{p,0}(S^{\sigma q}).\]
If $S(\sigma q)$ denotes the unit sphere inside $\R^{\sigma q}$ and $D(\sigma q)$ denotes the unit disc, then there
is a cofiber sequence
\begin{equation}
\label{signed_cofiber}
\xymatrix{
	S(\sigma q)\ar[r] & D(\sigma q)\ar[r] & S^{\sigma q},
}
\end{equation}
so $\wH_{C_2}^{p,0}(S^{\sigma q})\cong\wH_{C_2}^{p,0}(\Sigma S(\sigma q))$. This is the $\Z$-graded Bredon
cohomology of $\Sigma S(\sigma q)$, which if the $C_2$-action is free is the same thing as the ordinary cohomology
of the quotient. The $C_2$-action on $S(\sigma q)$ is the antipodal map, so the quotient is $\RP^{q-1}$, so
\[\wH_{C_2}^{p,0}(S^{\sigma q})\cong \wH_{C_2}^{p,0}(\Sigma S(\sigma q))\cong \wH^p(\Sigma\RP^{q-1}),\]
and we know what this is.

When $q > 0$, we use equivariant Spanier-Whitehead duality:
\[H_{C_2}^{p,q}(*)\cong \wH_{C_2}^{p,q}(S^0)\cong \wH_{-p,-q}^{C_2}(S^0)\cong \wH_{-p,0}(S^{\sigma q}).\]
Once again we'll apply $\wH_{*,0}$ to the cofiber sequence, and conclude when $k\ne 0,1$, $\wH_{k,0}(S^{\sigma
q})\cong \wH_{k-1,0}(S(\sigma q))$, which will again relate to projective spaces; for $k = 0,1$, we'll have to open
up the long exact sequence.

Inducting over the cofiber sequence is a common trick, and is a good one to carry with you.

Let's recall some Mackey functors from \cref{Mackeyexm}. We'll write them out carefully so as to not make a
mistake. The constant Mackey functor $\underline\Z$ is
\[\xymatrix{
	\Z\ar@/^0.4cm/[d]^2\ar@(ul,ur)^\id\\
	\Z,\ar@/^0.4cm/[u]^\id
}\]
where the top entry corresponds to the orbit $C_2/e$, and the bottom to the orbit $C_2/C_2$. There's another Mackey
functor, denoted $\underline\Z\rop$, given by the diagram
\[\xymatrix{
	\Z\ar@/^0.4cm/[d]^\id\ar@(ul,ur)^\id\\
	\Z.\ar@/^0.4cm/[u]^2
}\]
If $\pi\colon C_2\times X\to X$ is projection onto the second factor and $M$ is a Mackey functor, we get maps going
both ways:
\[\xymatrix{
	H_{C_2}^{p,q}(X;M)\ar@<0.1cm>[r]^-{\pi^*} & H_{C_2}^{p,q}(C_2\times X; M).\ar@<0.1cm>[l]^-{\pi_!}
}\]
Finally, it'll be good to remember a fact about the dimension axiom: the transfers in a Mackey functor $M$ coincide
with the transfer maps in cohomology induced by maps between orbits.

Anyways, we were computing $H_{C_2}^{p,q}(*)$, where $p$ is the \term{fixed dimension} and $q$ is the \term{sign
dimension}, i.e.\ indexed by the $C_2$-representation $V \coloneqq \R^p\oplus\sigma^q$, where $\R$ is the trivial
representation and $\sigma$ is the sign representation. First, we computed that
\[H_{C_2}^{p,q}(C_2)\cong H^{p+q}(\pt) = \begin{cases}
	\Z, &p+q = 0\\
	0, &\text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}\]
If $q > 0$, then we computed
\[H^{-p.-q}_{C_2}(*) \cong \wH_{C_2}^{p,0}(S^{\sigma q})\cong\wH^p(\Sigma\RP^{q-1}),\]
because the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms meant that for a free action, we can compute the nonequivariant cohomology of
the quotient.

To compute $H_{C_2}^{p,q}(*)$, we use duality:
\[H_{C_2}^{p,q}(*) \cong \wH^{p,q}_{C_2}(S^0)\cong \wH_{-p,-q}(S^0)\cong \wH_{-p,0}(S^{\sigma q}),\]
and that's where we left off. To continue, we'll use the cofiber sequence~\eqref{signed_cofiber}, as well as its
based version
\begin{equation}
\label{based_signed}
\xymatrix{
	S(\sigma q)_+\ar[r] & D(\sigma q)_+\ar[r] & S^{\sigma q},
}
\end{equation}
and it's worth noting that the middle space is equivalent to $S^0$, which is sometimes implicit in the literature.

If $k\ne 0,1$, apply $\wH_{k,0}$ to~\eqref{signed_cofiber} to conclude that
\[\wH_{k,0}(S^{q\sigma})\cong \wH_{k-1}(S(\sigma q))\]
and therefore that
\[\wH_{C_2}^{p,q}(*)\cong \wH_{-p-1}(\RP^{q-1}).\]
Recall that the cohomology of $\RP^m$ is
\[H^i(\RP^m) = \begin{cases}
	\Z, &i = 0\\
	\Z, &i = m\text{ and $m$ is odd}\\
	\Z/2, &0 < i < m\text{ and $i$ is odd}\\
	0, &\text{otherwise,}
\end{cases}\]
so we get a bunch of copies of $\Z$ and $\Z/2$.

That leaves $k = 0,1$, for which we must look at the long exact sequence
\[\xymatrix{
	0\ar[r] & \wH_{1,0}(S^{q\sigma})\ar[r] & \wH_{0,0}(S(q\sigma))\ar[r]^-\gamma &\Z\ar[r] &
	\wH_{0,0}(S^{q\sigma})\ar[r] & 0.
}\]
\begin{claim}
$\gamma$ is multiplication by $2$, and therefore $\wH_{1,0}(S^{q\sigma})\cong 0$ and
$\wH_{0,0}(S^{q\sigma})\cong\Z/2$.
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
The idea is to identify the map $\gamma$ as the transfer map for the Mackey functor $\underline\Z$. Said another
way, we want to see $\gamma$ as coming from the map $H_{0,0}(C_2)\to H_{0,0}(\pt)$ associated to the map $C_2\to
*$. This follows from the dimension axiom and the fact that $S(\sigma)\cong C_2$.
\end{proof}
So now, how do we express this in terms of Mackey functors? This is only nontrivial in the $C_2$ orbit and when the
cohomology is nonzero (the zero Mackey functor is not hard to define). Thus, we care about the case $p+q = 0$.

Consider the long exact sequence
\[\xymatrix{
	H_{C_2}^{-(2n-1), 2n-1}(*) & H_{C_2}^{-2n,2n}(C_2)\ar[l]\\
	& H_{C_2}^{-2n,2n}(C_2)\ar[u]_\zeta & H_{C_2}^{-2n,2n-1}(*),\ar[l]
}\]
which comes from~\eqref{signed_cofiber} when $q = 1$, i.e.\ the cofiber sequence $C_2\to S^0\to S^\sigma$. The map
$\zeta$ is the transfer in the Mackey functor.
\begin{ex}
Show, using the double coset formula, that when $n > 0$, $\zeta$ is an isomorphism, and when $n < 0$, it's
multiplication by $2$.
\end{ex}
That is, when $n > 0$, the cohomology, as a Mackey functor, is $\underline\Z$, and when $n < 0$, it's
$\underline\Z\rop$.
